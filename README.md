# Class Scheduler Application â€“ CS4076 Event-Driven Programming Project

This pair project is a **TCP protocol-based client-server service** for scheduling classes. It consists of two applications:  

- **Client Application**: A GUI-based app used to send class scheduling requests to the server.  
- **Server Application**: A console-based app that stores schedules, handles requests, and responds to the client.  

The communication protocol is message-based, with alternating send/receive actions. The client initiates a request, the server performs the action, and responds. The connection is terminated when the client presses the **STOP** button, after which the server sends a **TERMINATE** message and closes the connection.  

All operations use **exception handling**, including a custom `IncorrectActionException` thrown when an invalid action format is detected.

## Key Features

- **Add Class**: Schedule a class at a specified date, time, and room. Detects and prevents scheduling clashes.  
- **Remove Class**: Remove a class from the schedule and free the corresponding time slot.  
- **Display Schedule**: View the full schedule for a specific class (console output).  
- **Early Lecture Feature**: Reschedule a class to an earlier time in the day if no clashes exist.

## Development

- **Language**: Java (Event-Driven Programming & TCP Sockets)  
- **Client GUI**: Swing-based GUI controls for input and displaying responses  
- **Server**: Console-based memory collection (ArrayList, HashMap) for schedules  
- **Exception Handling**: Custom `IncorrectActionException` for invalid actions  
- **Communication Protocol**: TCP client-server, alternating message exchange
